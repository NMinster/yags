To get YAGS running as a developer:

1. Install rcov
     sudo gem install rcov
2. Set up your databases, and create an appropriate config/database.yml.
   --> NEVER commit config/database.yml to svn!
3. Create a log folder in the main project.
   --> NEVER commit this folder to svn!
4. Run the db:migrate rake task.
5. Run all of the tests.
6. Enjoy!
