To get this Rails thing up and running, there are a few things you need to do.

1. Set up your databases, and create an appropriate config/database.yml.
   --> NEVER commit config/database.yml to svn!
2. Create a log folder in the main project.
   --> NEVER commit this folder to svn!
3. Run the db:migrate rake task.
4. Run all of the tests.
5. Enjoy!
